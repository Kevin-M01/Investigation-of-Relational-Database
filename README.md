# Investigation-of-Relational-Database
Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python - Project I

## Description
In this project, a PostgreSQL was setup on my local machine using the data from Sakila Movie Sample Database. After the initial setup, I connected the database through the pgAdmin tool and loaded it in to query findings about the data. Once all the data for each query was satisfied, the findings were stored in CSV files which were put into a PowerPoint presentation to show the data with visual tools.

## Software Tools
To complete this project, the following software tools are:

- PostgreSQL using pgAdmin
- A text editor (Sublime, Atom, Notepad, etc)
- A terminal application (Git Bash, Command Prompt, etc)

## Database Information
The DVD rental database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store. The DVD rental database has many objects including:

- 15 tables
- 1 trigger
- 7 views
- 8 functions
- 1 domain
